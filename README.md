I have modified an application downloaded from GitHub as a test
area for Node development.

The original application was Labled: ExpressJs + Passport.js + MySQL Authentication
I am unsure of the author but will add it when I come across it again.


An authentication system using 
  passportjs 
   and mysql as the data storage for the users, 
   while using expressjs module to facilitate the routing.

git commands for my reference

local: git push origin <branch> (either master or development)
